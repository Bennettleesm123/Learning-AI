# Basic Machine Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn the fundamental concepts of machine learning through hands-on experience. It includes a dataset, a Jupyter notebook for interactive learning, and Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
  - `dataset.csv`: The dataset in CSV format, including features and labels.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning.
  - `learning_ml.ipynb`: A notebook with code snippets and explanations for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **src/**: Contains Python scripts for various tasks.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
  - `model_training.py`: Code for training the machine learning model.
  - `model_evaluation.py`: Functions for evaluating the trained model.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project, such as pandas, scikit-learn, and Jupyter.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/learning_ml.ipynb` to start learning.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it using:
   ```
   pip install jupyter
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `learning_ml.ipynb` from the notebooks directory and follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the project.
